# Java Trade Simulator (Matching Engine)

A Java-based stock exchange simulator that models how real-world exchanges
match BUY and SELL orders using **price–time priority**.

This project implements a simplified but realistic **limit order book**
and matching engine using a **custom binary heap** instead of Java’s built-in
priority queue.
